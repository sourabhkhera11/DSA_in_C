# 📘 Data Structures and Algorithms in C (with Java support for transitioners)

Welcome! This repository contains 25+ essential DSA questions implemented in **C**, with a few initial programs also written in **Java** to help Java learners 
transition smoothly into C programming. This collection is particularly useful for:

- 🧑‍🎓 Students preparing for university exams where C is the mandated language for DSA.
- 💡 Java learners who are switching to C and need side-by-side references.
- 🚀 Anyone revising DSA concepts with hands-on practice in core topics.

## 📌 Why This Repository?

When starting out, I found it challenging to find clean, example-based DSA implementations in C. 
So I began curating and writing them myself. Over time, this turned into a full set of practice problems that I hope can help others as well — especially students like me.
